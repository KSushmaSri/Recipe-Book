                    <h1>Poha</h1>
                    <p>Poha is a light and flavorful breakfast dish made from flattened rice, which is quick to prepare and easy to digest. It is a popular breakfast choice in Indian households, especially in Western and Central India, like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Poha is often cooked with onions, green chilies, mustard seeds, and garnished with fresh coriander, peanuts, and a squeeze of lemon for tanginess. Nutritious and filling, poha can also be customized with vegetables like peas, potatoes, or carrots, making it a versatile and delicious meal.</p>

                        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2 cups thick poha (flattened rice)</li>
                            <li>1 medium onion (finely chopped)</li>
                            <li>1-2 green chilies (finely chopped)</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
                            <li>1 sprig curry leaves</li>
                            <li>¼ cup roasted peanuts (optional)</li>
                            <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
                            <li>Salt to taste</li>
                            <li>Fresh coriander leaves (for garnish)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>    
                    <div class="Process">
                        <h1>Procedure</h1>
                            <ul>         
                                <li>Rinse the poha under running water in a strainer. Gently press the poha to remove excess water, but don't over-soak. Set aside.</li>
                                <li>Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then, add curry leaves, green chilies, and peanuts (if using). Sauté until the peanuts turn golden brown.</li>
                                <li>Add the chopped onions and potatoes to the pan. Cook until the onions turn translucent and the potatoes are soft (about 5-6 minutes).</li>
                                <li>Add turmeric powder and salt to the onion-potato mixture and mix well. Add the drained poha and stir gently to combine, ensuring the turmeric coats the poha evenly. If you prefer a slightly sweet flavor, add sugar at this stage.</li>
                                <li>Cook the poha on low heat for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the poha is heated through, turn off the heat. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
