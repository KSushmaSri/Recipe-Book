            <h1>Dosa</h1>
            <p>Dosa is a popular South Indian breakfast dish made from fermented rice and lentil batter. It's a thin, crispy crepe that can be served plain or stuffed with a variety of fillings, such as spiced mashed potatoes (aloo masala). Traditionally, dosa is served with coconut chutney and sambar, a tangy lentil soup. Its versatility and delightful texture make it a beloved choice for breakfast across India. Not only is it delicious, but dosa is also nutritious, being a good source of carbohydrates and proteins.</p>
            <div class="Ingredients">Ingredients
                <ul>
                    <li>Rice (preferably parboiled rice or dosa rice) – 2 cups</li>
                    <li>Urad dal (split black gram) – ½ cup</li>
                    <li>Fenugreek seeds – ½ teaspoon</li>
                    <li>Salt – to taste</li>
                    <li>Water – as needed (for soaking and grinding)</li>
                    <li>Oil or ghee – for cooking the dosa</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="Process">Making Dosa Batter
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rinse rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 4–6 hours.</li>
                        <li>Rinse Black gram and fenugreek seeds, then soak them together in a separate bowl for 4–6 hours.</li>
                        <li>Drain the soaked urad dal and fenugreek seeds, and grind them in a blender or wet grinder. Add water gradually (as needed) to make a smooth, fluffy batter.</li>
                        <li>Next, drain the rice and grind it to a slightly coarse consistency, adding water as needed.</li>
                        <li>Combine the ground urad dal and rice batter in a large bowl. Stir well to form a smooth batter with a slightly thick, pouring consistency.</li>
                        <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
                        <li>Cover the batter and allow it to ferment overnight (8–12 hours) in a warm place. The batter should rise and become airy and slightly sour.</li>
                        <span>How to make Dosa</span>
                        <li>Once fermented, stir the batter gently. Heat a non-stick griddle or tawa and pour a ladleful of batter onto it. Spread it in a circular motion to make a thin dosa. Drizzle oil or ghee around the edges and cook until golden brown and crispy.</li>
                        <p><span>Note:</span>The fermented batter can be stored in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.</p>

                        <li>In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This step adds flavor and tenderizes the chicken.</li>
