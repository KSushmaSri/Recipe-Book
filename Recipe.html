                        <li>Salt – to taste</li>
                        <li>Water – as needed (for soaking and grinding)</li>

                    <h1>Making Dosa Batter</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rinse rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 4–6 hours.</li>
                            <li>Rinse Black gram and fenugreek seeds, then soak them together in a separate bowl for 4–6 hours.</li>
                            <li>Drain the soaked urad dal and fenugreek seeds, and grind them in a blender or wet grinder. Add water gradually (as needed) to make a smooth, fluffy batter.</li>
                            <li>Next, drain the rice and grind it to a slightly coarse consistency, adding water as needed.</li>
                            <li>Combine the ground urad dal and rice batter in a large bowl. Stir well to form a smooth batter with a slightly thick, pouring consistency.</li>
                            <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
                            <li>Cover the batter and allow it to ferment overnight (8–12 hours) in a warm place. The batter should rise and become airy and slightly sour.</li>
                            <h1>How to make Dosa</h1>
                            <li>Once fermented, stir the batter gently. Heat a non-stick griddle or tawa and pour a ladleful of batter onto it. Spread it in a circular motion to make a thin dosa. Drizzle oil or ghee around the edges and cook until golden brown and crispy.</li>
                            <p><span>Note:</span>The fermented batter can be stored in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.</p>
