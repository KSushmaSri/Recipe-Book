                <h1>Chicken Curry</h1>
                <p>Chicken curry is a beloved dish across India, with each region offering its own variation. Typically, chicken is cooked in a rich, spiced gravy made from a blend of aromatic spices, onions, tomatoes, and sometimes coconut or yogurt. The curry is flavorful, with a balance of heat, tanginess, and depth, and is usually served with rice, naan, roti, or parathas.</p>

                    </ul>

                    <div class="Process">
                        <h1>Process</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This step adds flavor and tenderizes the chicken.</li>
                            <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large pan. Add cumin seeds, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves, and sauté until aromatic</li>
                            <li>Add the chopped onions and green chilies. Sauté until the onions become golden brown.</li>
                            <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
                            <li>Add the chopped or pureed tomatoes and cook until the mixture becomes soft and oil starts to separate from the sides.</li>
                            <li>Stir in turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin powder. Cook the spices for a minute to release their flavors.</li>
                            <li>Add the marinated or plain chicken pieces. Stir well to coat the chicken in the spice mixture. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until the chicken starts to change color.</li>
                            <li>Add water (or coconut milk if using) to the pan, enough to create a gravy. Cover and cook the chicken for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it's tender and cooked through.</li>
                            <li>Adjust the consistency of the gravy by adding more water if needed.</li>
                            <li>Add garam masala and cook for another 2-3 minutes to enhance the flavor.</li>
                            <li>Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves and serve the chicken curry hot.</li>
                        </ul>
