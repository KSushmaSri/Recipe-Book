                    <h1>Medu Vada</h1>
                    <p>Vada is a popular South Indian snack that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It is typically made from lentils (such as urad dal) or potatoes, flavored with spices, and deep-fried to perfection. There are different types of vadas like medu vada, masala vada, and batata vada. Medu vada, the most common version, is often served with coconut chutney and sambar, making it a staple dish in Indian breakfasts or as a snack during festivals.</p>

                        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 cup urad dal (black gram, split and skinned)</li>
                            <li>1-2 green chilies (finely chopped)</li>
                            <li>1-inch piece ginger (grated)</li>
                            <li>1 sprig curry leaves (finely chopped)</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon black peppercorns (optional)</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
                            <li>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
                            <li>Salt to taste</li>
                            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
                            <li>Water (for grinding)</li>
                            <li>Fresh coriander leaves (chopped, optional)</li>
                            <li>1 small onion (finely chopped, optional)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>    
                    <div class="Process">
                        <h1>Process</h1>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Rinse the urad dal thoroughly and soak it in water for at least 4-5 hours or overnight.</li>
                                <li>Drain the water from the soaked dal. In a grinder, add the dal with minimal water (about 1-2 tablespoons) and grind it into a smooth, fluffy batter. The consistency should be thick enough to hold shape.</li>
                                <li>Transfer the batter into a bowl and add chopped green chilies, grated ginger, curry leaves, cumin seeds, peppercorns, asafoetida, and salt. Mix well. You can also add chopped onions and coriander leaves for added flavor.</li>
                                <li>Wet your hands with water, take a small portion of the batter, and shape it into a doughnut-like circle with a hole in the middle. This can also be done by placing the batter on a plastic sheet or banana leaf and making the hole using your thumb.</li>
                                <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully drop the shaped vadas into the oil. Fry them in batches until they turn golden brown and crispy on both sides.</li>
                                <li>Once fried, remove the vadas from the oil and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
                                <li>Serve the crispy Medu Vada hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or both.</li>
