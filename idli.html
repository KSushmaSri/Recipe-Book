                    <h1>Idli</h1>
                    <p>Idli is a popular South Indian breakfast dish made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). These soft, fluffy, steamed rice cakes are light, nutritious, and easy to digest, making them a perfect morning meal or snack. Idlis are typically served with coconut chutney and sambar, and they are often considered one of the healthiest breakfasts due to their minimal use of oil and the benefits of fermentation. Their soft texture and mild flavor also make them kid-friendly and versatile.</p>

                        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 cup urad dal (black gram, split and skinned)</li>
                            <li>2 cups idli rice (or parboiled rice)</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
                            <li>Salt to taste</li>
                            <li>Water (for soaking and grinding)</li>
                            <li>Oil or ghee (for greasing the idli molds)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h1>Process</h1>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Rinse the urad dal and rice separately. Soak the urad dal along with fenugreek seeds (if using) in water for about 4-5 hours. Soak the rice in water for the same amount of time.</li>
                                <li>Drain the water from the soaked urad dal and rice. First, grind the urad dal into a smooth and fluffy batter by adding little water gradually. Set it aside. Next, grind the soaked rice into a slightly coarse batter (similar to semolina texture) by adding water as needed.</li>
                                <li>Combine the urad dal and rice batter in a large bowl. Add salt to taste and mix well. Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-10 hours or overnight, depending on the climate. The batter should rise and become light and airy after fermentation.</li>
                                <li>Grease the idli molds lightly with oil or ghee. Mix the fermented batter gently without stirring too much. Pour the batter into the idli molds, filling each mold about ¾ full.</li>
                                <li>Heat water in an idli steamer or a large pot with a steamer attachment. Place the filled idli molds in the steamer, cover, and steam for 10-15 minutes on medium heat. You can check if the idlis are done by inserting a toothpick or skewer into the center – it should come out clean.</li>
                                <li>Once steamed, remove the idli molds from the steamer and let them cool for a minute. Use a spoon to carefully remove the idlis from the molds.</li>
